            I’ve never been great at design systems. Probably because, with a
            lack of designers on the team, I ended up building component
            libraries and reusing a few (hundred) style values. When DTCG
            released a stable design tokens specification, I got very excited
            and couldn’t stop myself from creating an app around it. It felt
            like a great opportunity to learn design systems.

            I have been building UI for the Web at

            Using opencode for rapid prototyping and Svelte as a lightweight
            framework (already worked with it), I made a simple two-pane UI: a
            tokens tree on the left and generated CSS variables on the right. AI
            helps a ton with moving forward from blank pages.

            While I was working on the prototype, Adam Argyle released a great
            new
            <a href="https://github.com/argyleink/css-color-component"
              >color picker</a
            >
            with all modern color spaces supported in CSS. By the way, the
            design tokens specification relies on those exact color spaces for
            color tokens. Perfect timing.

            color-input uses super cool
            <a href="https://colorjs.io">colorjs.io</a> library, which I had
            never found before because I was spelling it wrong when searching :)

            Then I rebuilt the tree again. I relied heavily on the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/"
              >WAI-ARIA</a
            >
            recommendations and Adam Argyle’s advice to always support
            multi-select. Drag-and-drop is still tricky, especially choosing the
            right parent to drop into, need to make it more intuitive.

            Now we have a token editor and CSS/JSON preview. That’s good for
            coding but not for visual exploration. We need to generate a style
            guide from these tokens. I could ask AI to generate style guides,
            but instead I asked it to generate a style guide generator. And it
            did. I’m especially happy with the cubic-bezier preview. Would reuse
            it for bezier editor later.

            For UI components, I decided to go with HTML. Yeah, it got a lot of
            good stuff recently.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Popover API for the app menu, adding tokens, and the token editor
            </li>
            <li>The dialog element for “About” info</li>
            <li>Invokers for declarative opening of dialogs and popovers</li>
            <li>Will definitely use interest invokers for tooltips</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These are very easy to polyfill, except for anchor positioning, but
            I worked around that with a custom
            <a href="https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui">floating-ui</a>
            setup.

            While researching I read a ton about design systems, especially
            recommend
            <a href="https://bradfrost.com">Brad Frost’s book and articles</a>.
            That’s where I learned how essential token aliasing is. One great
            concept is a 3-tier token architecture with arbitrary, semantic, and
            component values, where each layer maps to the next. The design
            tokens specification offers a few options for this. One is the
            “extends” syntax like {{path.to.my.token}} (already supported in
            this app), another uses JSON Schema refs (which I find tricky to use
            in a UI).

            By the way, I called this tool <strong>Engramma</strong>. I wanted
            an original name, so I borrowed it from one of my favorite games and
            used the Italian variant. You can check it out at
            <a href="https://engramma.dev">engramma.dev</a>.

            From the start, the project has been completely open source, and I’m
            posting progress everywhere Reddit can’t block me (yep, they’re
            super unfriendly to new users). You can check it out on

            What’s next? I’ll keep improving the tool and start using it for new
            projects. The closest ideas to implement:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Resolver specification to enable defining tokens for different
              themes and color schemes
            </li>
            <li>Synchronize tokens with project code</li>
            <li>
              Explore connecting with external graphic editors and website
              builders
            </li>
          </ul>
