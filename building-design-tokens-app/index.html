            Working on a large project requires a systematic design approach to
            keep the user interface consistent. Often, this system is
            implemented as a set of pre-styled components or UI kits.
          </p>
          <p>
            The smallest piece of a design system is a token: a color, size, or
            typography configuration reusable across different components. In UI
            kits, themes with dozens of values are similar to tokens. You can
            override a theme and have your components updated. However, once a
            project matures, the theme may contain hundreds of values, and
            without a strong system, they become unmanageable.

            A few years ago, a community of designers and developers (Design
            Tokens Community Group or DTCG) decided to formalize how design
            tokens are defined and exchanged across tools and platforms.
            Recently, they released
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.designtokens.org">
              a stable design tokens format specification</a
            >, with strict types and more unified (less CSS-like) definitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I was very excited by how expressive it is compared to previous
            iterations and couldn’t stop myself from creating an app around it.
            Especially since I have a lot of experience building UI for web at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://webstudio.is">Webstudio</a> over
            the last three years and wanted to channel those ideas into
            something new.
          </p>
          <p>
            It felt like a great opportunity to get better at design systems.

            Using OpenCode for rapid prototyping and Svelte as a lightweight
            framework (already worked with it), I made a simple two-pane UI: a
            tokens tree on the left and generated CSS variables on the right. AI
            helps a ton with moving forward from "blank pages".

            Tokens tree on the left is custom-built. I relied heavily on the
            <a

              href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/"

              WAI-ARIA

            recommendations and on Adam Argyle’s advice to always support
            multi-select, based on his experience working on
            <a target="_blank" href="https://visbug.web.app/">VisBug</a>.
            Multi-select can be useful for bulk deleting or moving items into
            another folder with fewer repetitive actions.

            While I was working on the prototype, Adam Argyle released a great
            new
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://github.com/argyleink/css-color-component"
            >
              color picker
            </a>
            with all modern color spaces like OKLCH, LAB etc. supported in CSS.
            By the way, the design tokens specification relies on those exact
            color spaces for color tokens. Perfect timing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides picking colors, I still needed a way to parse them and
            convert them to the DTCG color format, so I needed a solid library
            to avoid getting lost in color specifications. color-input uses the
            super cool
            <a target="_blank" href="https://colorjs.io">colorjs.io</a> library.
            I’ve been hearing about it for years but never found it before,
            because I was spelling it wrong when searching :)

            For UI components, I decided to go with HTML. Yeah, it got a lot of
            good stuff recently.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Popover API for the app menu, adding tokens, and the token editor
            </li>
            <li>The dialog element for “About” info</li>
            <li>Invokers for declarative opening of dialogs and popovers</li>
            <li>Will definitely use interest invokers for tooltips</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These are very easy to polyfill, except for anchor positioning, but
            I worked around that with a custom
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://github.com/floating-ui/floating-ui"

            setup.

            Now we have a token editor and a CSS/JSON preview. That’s useful for
            coding, but not for visual exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            What would be more helpful is an automatically generated style guide
            based on design tokens. All these values could be rendered as
            widgets and placed on a single page for designers to browse.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s still room for improvement, though I already like the
            progress. Especially happy with the cubic-bezier preview, planning
            to reuse it for a bezier editor later.

            What about AI? Can design tokens improve the results of generated
            websites and applications? Experience shows that the more specific
            your question is, the better the results you get. Design tokens
            could help a lot with this, and it may be interesting to explore
            later.

            While researching I read a ton about design systems, especially
            recommend
            <a target="_blank" href="https://bradfrost.com">
              Brad Frost’s book and articles</a
            >. That’s where I learned how essential token aliasing is. One great
            concept is a 3-tier token architecture which defines arbitrary,
            semantic, and component values, where each layer maps to the next.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Tier 1 tokens define all available values in the design system,
              such as color-blue-100 or color-white.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tier 2 tokens map Tier 1 tokens to semantic roles in the UI, for
              example text-color-primary or color-border-destructive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tier 3 tokens are component-specific, such as button-bg-color or
              heading-text-color.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This component-specific tier can be leveraged even further by
            rendering a combination of these tokens as a component widget in
            Style Guide.

            The design tokens specification offers a few options for this. One
            is the
            <a

              href="https://www.designtokens.org/tr/2025.10/format/#references-and-json-pointer-integration"
            >
              token reference
            </a>
            syntax (I use this one in the app), another uses
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.designtokens.org/tr/2025.10/format/#json-pointer-support"
            >
              JSON Schema Pointer
            </a>
            (which I find trickier to represent in a UI).

            By the way, I called this tool <strong>Engramma</strong>. I wanted
            an original name, so I borrowed it from one of my favorite games and
            used the Italian variant. You can check it out at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://engramma.dev">engramma.dev</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the start, the project has been completely open source, and I’m
            posting progress everywhere Reddit can’t block me (yep, they’re
            super unfriendly to new users). You can check it out on
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TrySound/engramma"

            What’s next? I’ll keep improving the tool and start using it for new
            projects. Here are the closest ideas to implement:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Themes and light/dark modes support based on "Resolver"
              specification that extends the DTCG format with “Sets” and
              “Modifiers” to partially override values while reusing others.
            </li>
            <li>Synchronize tokens with project code</li>
            <li>
              Explore integrations with external graphics editors and website
              builders
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you work with design systems, I’d love your feedback on
            Engramma—try it at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://engramma.dev">engramma.dev</a>,
            import your JSON with tokens, and tell me what’s missing.
